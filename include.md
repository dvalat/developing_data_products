## Summary
This Shiny application is created by [VALAT Didier](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/didiervalat) for the **Coursera Course Project: Developing Data Products**.

It uses ```R``` standard **mtcars** dataset. The data was extracted from the 1974 **Motor Trend** US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

You can select the cars you want to analyze using the control panel located on the left side of the "**Graph**" tab. The data can also be displayed using the "**Data**" tab.
